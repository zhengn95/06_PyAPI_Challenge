# 06_PyAPI_Challenge
Challenge 6 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, I used what we learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

### Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. The citipy Python library and the [OpenWeatherMap API]( https://openweathermap.org/api) were used to create a representative model of weather across cities.

### Part 2: VacationPy
In this deliverable, I used the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 to plan future vacations. In this part, I used the Jupyter Notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the [Geoapify API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/) to create map visualizations.

Please see the **WeatherPy.ipynb** and **VacationPy.ipynb** files for the full analysis and explanation of weather data on January 9, 2024.
